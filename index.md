I am an undergraduate student at **Seoul National University**, studying **Aerospace Engineering**.

My research area is Robotics, where I mainly focus on localizing and mapping on robots.~~These works have been presented at major venues such as CHI, CSCW, and JMIR, recognized with CHI Honorable Mention Award.~~

I enjoy street dance, especially [Locking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CroeSYalTPg), to give myself a justifiable reason for procrastination.(./another-page.html).



Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

# Research area
My research focuses on designing and evaluating social computing systems that support real-world collaborative processes by harnessing machine intelligence

Specifically, my research aims to (i) surface challenges of collaborations arising in the multi-faceted user group and (ii) build AI-infused systems to support them

I like mixed-methods approach

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
